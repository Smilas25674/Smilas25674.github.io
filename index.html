    <h1>Silas's Stuff</h1>
    <p>Hello! This is basically Silas's glorified linktree for all of his projects and happenings (yes thats also the github desc.) 
        Currently, there is no CSS for this website, so if you don't see any, your computer is not glitching. 
        It's just because I haven't coded that yet.
    </p>
    <h2>Planned updates for this website include(but are not limited to):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><del>A link to all of my videos! (Which are unlisted on YouTube)</del></li>
        <li>A link to my projects!</li>
        <li>My accounts for various things! (STEAM, Minecraft/Xbox, Discord, etc.)</li>
        <li>A gallery of photos of me!</li>
        <li>A gallery of videos of me!</li>
        <li>A blog (possibly)</li>
        <li>+MORE!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will also add sections on the top of the page so that you can navigate the website
        easily. In addition, these will also be sorted by my various interests.
    </p>
    <p>In the meantime, please enjoy this photo of one of my dogs, Tilly:</p>
